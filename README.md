# TweetComposer
This is a demo project on how to use Apple's JavaScriptCore library, part of the WebKit project, inside a native iOS application.

This project shows a Tweet compose screen with a character counter. Twitter's public twitter-text.js library is used to detect links and adjust the character counter according to the shortened link size.

Please note this project is for educational purposes only, and probably no more makes sense since Twitter recently published an Objective-C version of the library.
